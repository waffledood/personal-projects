# Sticky Notes

Had a sudden creative burst that you need to pen down? Why use actual sticky notes when you can use virtual ones!

This project is purely front-end, but there are future features I plan to include:

- Local client caching to store user's data:
  - Text input into sticky notes
  - Location of sticky notes
  - Number of sticky notes placed
- Connect to a backend
  - Ability to create accounts

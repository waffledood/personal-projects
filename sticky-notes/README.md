# Sticky Notes

## Description

Had a sudden creative burst that you need to pen down? Why use actual sticky notes when you can use virtual ones! I got inspiration from this [image](https://www.vectorstock.com/royalty-free-vector/sticky-empty-notes-corkwood-board-on-wall-vector-23673918), but also the many brainstorming sessions I've had during hackathons, workshops & university classes.

This project is purely front-end, but there are future features I plan to include

## Planned Features

- Local client caching to store user's data:
  - Text input into sticky notes
  - Location of sticky notes
  - Number of sticky notes placed
- Connect to a backend
  - Ability to create accounts

## Tools Used

These were tools I used to help with the development of this project:

- [CSS Gradient](https://cssgradient.io/)
- [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/icons/note-sticky?f=classic&s=solid)
